                    oil
                    production. Fruity juniper berry oil clarifies oily, congested scalps, while lemon and lime
                    make
                    your
                    hair clean and shiny and give it an extra fresh scent. The incredible herbal duo of soothing
                    lavender and
                    cleansing rosemary calm and stimulate the scalp, because healthy hair comes from a healthy
                    scalp.

     <h4 class="headers">Customer Testimonials</h4>
     <paragraph class="text">I enjoyed using this shampoo bar for months before it started to break into smaller
          bits and pieces - now I'm managing to use these little pieces to finish off the bar. I will start by
          saying I was very impressed with how far just a little of this product would go. Just a few swipes on my
          hair would be enough to build a substantial lather and a great clean. This being said, if you are
          avoiding sulphates this product will not be for you! Lovely scent and I am so happy to have
          packaging-free hair products from LUSH. Looking forward to future iterations with gentler formulations
          (SLS free) and new scents. Will definitely keep purchasing shampoo bars from LUSH!
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph class="text2">Never thought with my long hair I would be a convert to the shampoo bar but I am
          sold! I love the story behind lush and their products so I wanted to try the shampoo bar since I had read
          a lot about it. I am thrilled to say I am hooked. It lathers great, I only wash my hair about once a week
          so I wash twice but it doesn't feel stripping. My hair just feels so clean with no clarifying shampoo
          needed! It has that squeaky clean scalp sound. I'm obsessed. üíØ try it. Travels amazingly and I can't
          imagine going back now! Thank you lush! üôèüèª</paragraph>
